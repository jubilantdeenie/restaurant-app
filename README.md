## Overview 

This project was created in completion of Udacity's Front End Applications course for the Front End Developer Nanodegree. 

Original content was provided with the direction to take the "static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use." (Udacity) Also required was adding a service worker for a seamless offline experience for users.

Mapbox was used to generate an API key for the map. Changes were made in CSS to add flexibility to the site and images. Chrome Dev Tools were used to determine updates required for accessibility. A11y features have been added in HTML. The service worker is completed in JavaScript. This project was created using python to run the page on a localhost server. 


## Instructions (from Udacity)

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m http.server 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
